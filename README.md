# Welcome to Jdromeda :camel:
Jdromeda is a project to make it easy for Java-Developers to create beautiful and functional web applications. Maybe you know the project GWT (Google Web Toolkit)? It is a role model, however it is nowadays incredible slow for large applications. Additionally it is hard to integrate classic JavaScript components. Therefore, we want to rewrite the idea of the Google Web Toolkit. With the development of TypeScript it is easier to generate useful and powerful JavaScript Code form Java by using the TypeScript as a step in between. The next section would bring some more details about the background of this project. However, the most of you would like to jump to the [Getting Started Section](#getting-started). 
But first of all, some motivation of how simple Jdromeda is: 

```java
    // Create a new Button 
	Button button = new Button("Hello World");
	// Add ClickListener for Callback
	b.addClickListener(new ClickListener() {
			@Override
			public void click(Event e) {
				alert("click!");
    	}
	});
```
